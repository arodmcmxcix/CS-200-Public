# CS-200-Public
Public repository containing README's regarding project objectives and what was learned.

For CS 200 I completed 2 larger projects worth mentioning. Known as BP1 and BP2 


BP1:
This game was modeled after Sokoban [Game description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban). Given this was
the first major CS project there were no graphics plugins. We used ASCII characters to represent boxes and where
they should be pushed. The game board was described in a three-dimensional array.

Gameplay:
The gameplay was via an infinite loop that read in user commands for movement and by how many units up, down, left,
and right. This input was processed to ensure that the user was not leaving the gameboard and thus the movements
applied to the gameboard and the user can print the new configuration. 

BP2:
For our second project, we were tasked to recreate a miniature AI named Eliza that receives a text file as input
and can interact with users by identifying words in the input and matching them to the text file for a predetermined 
output. The overall AI had a limited set of vocabulary and as such was comical to interact with. Students were able
to increase the file on their own account to improve Eliza's ability to communicate with a user. 

Source code is listed in a private directory due to the University of Wisconsin-Madison's academic policies.
