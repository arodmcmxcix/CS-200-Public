# CS-200-Public
Public repository containing README's regarding project objectives and what was learned.

For CS 200 I completed 2 larger projects of worth mentioning. Known as BP1 and BP2 


BP1:
This was a game modeled after Sokoban [Game description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban). Given this was
the first major cs project there were no graphics plugins. We used ASCII character to represent boxes and where
they should be pushed to. The game board was described in a three dimensional array.

Gameplay:
The gameplay was via an infinite loop that read in user commands for movement and by how many units up, down, left,
and right. This input was processed to ensure that the user was not leaving the gameboard and thus the movments
applied to the gameboard and the user can print the new configuration. 

BP2:
For our second project we were tasked to recreate a miniature AI named Eliza that receives a text file as an input
and can interact with users by identifiying words in the input and mathcing them to the text file for a predetermined 
output. The overal AI had a limited set of vocabulary and as such was commical to interact with. Students were able
to increase the file on their own account to improve Eliza's ability to communicate with a user. 

Source code is listed in a private directory due to the University of Wisconsin - Madison's academc policies.
